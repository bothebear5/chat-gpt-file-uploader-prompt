# chat-gpt-file-uploader-prompt
ChatGPT file uploader + Prompt input

This is a chrome extension that I modified by using ChatGPT to edit the code. The original author is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-file-uploader/oaogphgfdbdbmhkiplemgehihiiececj

With this extension, you get a button to send a file to chatGPT. The text is sliced by the chunks (5000 each, for English Users, change that to 15000) and it sends each chunk to ChatGpt. You can add a prompt for each chunk by using the text input box below.

To install this extension simply go to chrome://extensions in your browser, choose "developer mode" and click "load unpacked extension." Choose the entire unzipped folder.
